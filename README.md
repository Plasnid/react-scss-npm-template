react-scss-npm-template
=======================

Welcome to the 2017 Web Technologies template project. My aim is to provide a working template that evolves as technology does. This project comes from my desire to keep on top of the continuously changing field of tools. It's daunting, and often it is tricky for folks just learning to find a good resource.

So far the project includes the following technologies:

-	Node
-	NPM
-	SASS
-	Babel
-	Webpack
-	React
-	React Router V4
-	jsx

My aim is to also include:

-	Redux* Mocha
-	Chai
-	Whatever else I come across that pulls my attention and seems useful

It may not be perfect, but if it gives anyone(myself included) a leg up, then give it a look.
